In this research I aim to explore the cyclical effects of how the oppression of education affects the sexual behavior of adolescents. The institutional oppression of education among low income areas in the United States has a direct impact on the coverage of sexual education. These curriculums teach significant information regarding consent, pregnancy prevention, the risks of sexually transmitted infections, and how to address sexuality safely. Sexual education programs are disproportionate among socioeconomic statuses, and in turn, leave the responsibility of sexual education on to the parents of these students. I hope to explore ways in which to combat this dangerous cycle, and take action against the oppression of education.

In this research I aim to explore the social ideas and realities surrounding procreation. This work follows the idea of how the act of child-bearing and working mothers can become tools in the prospering of capitalism. This results in a set of unrealistic expectations of the mother, an imbalance of responsibility and labor given to her, the mistreatment and stigmatization of women who choose not to procreate, and the false assumptions of why we have the need and desire to become parents. This system is created and upheld through stigmas and narratives by family, friend groups, religious institutions, and other areas of socialization. This research can be used to better understand the interests of the system, how it benefits from the installment of the hegemonic gender roles given to men and women surrounding procreation, and how it receives and maintains power in order to continue functioning.

In this research I aim to explore the oppression women face within the Christian church, and how that oppression inevitably repeats itself. This work sources the root of misogyny in the church, the traits of a faithful woman, and the expectations she will face at different stages in her life. This includes her role within the family and within the church. This research will cover class systems within the church, particularly the ways in which women oppress other women, and the psychological and spiritual distress that results from this.
